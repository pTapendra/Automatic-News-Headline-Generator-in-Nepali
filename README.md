# Automatic-News-Headline-Generator-Nepali

## Overview
```
This project is focused on generating headlines for Nepali news using
a well-trained deep neural network model. A Transformer model based on
encoder-decoder architecture was used for generating the headlines. It was trained on
Nepali language datasets collected from different online news portals. The model was
validated on a test dataset with rogue metrics. For training data, the average ROUGE
scores were 11.4, 3.65, 11.4 for rogue-1, rogue-2, and rogue-L respectively. For the
testing set, the corresponding ROUGE scores were 7.85, 1.47, and 7.39 respectively.
```
The model was based on this paper [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).
